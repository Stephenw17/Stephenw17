# 👋 Hi, I'm Stephen!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about leveraging the vast possibilities of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Optimization, and Anomoly Detection to name a few to deliver solutions to complex problems. 

## 👀 Interests
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: From sentiment analysis to complex language models, I love diving into the intricacies of language understanding.
- **Data Science**: Analyzing data to uncover hidden patterns and insights is my forte.
- **Machine Learning**: Constantly experimenting with algorithms and models to solve real-world problems.
- ** Social Media Intelligence**: Leveraging the wealth of information to be found in online discourse to represent consumer/user feedback at scale.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Exploring transformer models and their applications.
- **Data Engineering**: Enhancing my skills in building robust data pipelines and infrastructure.
- **Bi-LSTM**: Have a built a few such models, but can always learn more! 

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate
- **NLP Projects**: I’m particularly interested in projects that involve language processing and NLP. If you’re working on something exciting in this area, let’s connect!
